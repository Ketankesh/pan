                                <h3>Refund and cancellation Policy </h3>
                                <h5>Introduction</h5>
                                <p>PAN SUVIDHA intentions for publishing a policy on Online Payment and Refund Policy are not to impose restrictions that are contrary to PAN SUVIDHA established culture of openness, trust-worthy and integrity.</p>
                                <p>Effective service and monitoring is a team effort involving the participation and support of every PAN SUVIDHA employee and affiliate who deals with information and/or information systems. It is the responsibility of every employee to know these guidelines, and to conduct their activities accordingly.</p>
                                <h5>Purpose of the Policy</h5>
                                <p>The purpose of this policy is to facilitate online fund transfer to our business associates to avoid latency/delay in services. These services are to enhance the online payment transactions towards our Clients, Investors and Individuals.</p>
                                <h5>Scope of Policy</h5>
                                <p>This policy applies to employees, Clients, Investors, Sub-brokers, and other Business associates at PAN SUVIDHA. This policy also applies to all business activities those are performed through PAN SUVIDHA website.</p>
                                <h5>All payments are subject to the following conditions:-</h5>
                                <p>PAN SUVIDHA is only provides the services and do not sell any of the product, hence any kind of refund for products does not exist. However, in event of failed transaction, the amount shall be credited/refunded back to user or userâ€™s card account as per payment gateway policies. During any transaction, the website shall notify the user about the payment gateway being used.</p>
                                <p>The descriptions of services of fund transfers are specific to your need, when you log in with your unique password. Normally payment is required in advance (i.e. before you commence your activity). All charges quoted are in Indian Rupees. Your payment will normally reach the PAN SUVIDHA account to which you are making a payment within two working days.</p>
                                <p>We cannot accept liability for payment not reaching the PAN SUVIDHA account due to incorrect account number or incorrect personal details quoted by the user. Neither can we accept liability if payment is refused or declined by the credit/debit card supplier for any reason.</p>
                                <p>If the card supplier declines payment, PAN SUVIDHA is under no obligation to bring this fact to your attention. You should check with your bank/credit/debit card supplier that payment has been deducted from your account.</p>
                                <h5>Refund Policy</h5>
                                <p>The amount transferred through online against obligation is non refundable. The Service Charges and Taxes (as applicable for online payment) paid in addition to the amount is also non- refundable. If the user do not avail the purpose of amount transferred, there shall be no entitlement to refund of payment made which includes amount, service charges and taxes, as applicable.</p>
                                <p>Refunds, if applicable, at the discretion of the Management, will only be made to the debit/credit card used for the original transaction.</p>
                                <h5>Refund Policy in case of Broken Payment Transaction</h5>
                                <p>During the Online payment, the amount including applicable Service charges and taxes is debited from the related account but payment status is not updated successfully at PAN SUVIDHA this payment transaction is referred as <strong>Broken Payment Transaction</strong>.</p>
                                <p>The payment debited against the <strong>Broken Payment Transaction</strong> is refundable and components of applicable Service Charges and Taxes in the paid amount are non-refundable. The refund of the refundable amount against the Broken Payment Transaction shall be made by the Bank as per RBI guidelines.</p>
